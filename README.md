How To Build Websites On Your Own Computer - Session 1 Activity


Instructions: This activity is really about getting you familiar with VS Code, a common IDE (Integrated Developer Environment), and how you will use it to code on your local computer. Complete the following steps for this activity:

Activity: Create a simple 2-page application about a topic of your choice. You may use Bootstrap if you would like, but it’s not necessary.

1. On Github, create a repository called “First_VS_Code_Project”.

2. Using the command line, clone this repository to a directory location of your choosing. (Example: you could create a directory on your local computer called ‘GenerationUSA’ and then clone your repository inside it.)

3. Navigate into your newly cloned repository and create the following folders and files according to this structure ======================>

4. Open the ‘First_VS_Code_Project’ folder in VS Code. (If you can do it via the command line shortcut, GREAT!)

5. In VS Code, do the following things: 
  a. Link your css file to both the index.html and about.html files.
  b. Create a navbar in both the index.html and about.html files that can be used to navigate back-n-forth between pages.
  c. Add elements to both the index.html and about.html files. These can be of your own choosing (example: header, paragraph/s, list, etc)
  d. Add image files to your images folder and include these in your index.html and/or about.html files. It’s easiest to save images from a google images search.
  e. Use any remaining time to style the pages as you like.

6. Push your local repository to Github.

7. Go to Github and find the repository. (See image below)
  a. Click “settings”
  b. Click “Pages”
  c. Copy the link for your site.
  d. Paste your site link in the student slack channel -> #jfs_nat_004_students
